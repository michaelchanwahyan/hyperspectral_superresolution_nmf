Hyperspectral imaging systems have recently drawn significant interest in
areas such as computer vision, signal processing, and remote sensing because
of their ability to provide rich information in both spectral and spatial
domain of a scene.
These imaging systems acquire spectral images from far infrared to visible
range with many spectral bands, resulting in images that have a lot more
spectral bands than that of the conventional multispectral images.
Due to hardware limitation, spectral cameras with high resolution in both
spectral and spatial domain are uncommon, especially in the application of
remote satellite imagery.
The sensors are usually called hyperspectral camera and multispectral camera.
%The sensors are usually hyperspectral camera and multispectral camera, which
%capture images with high spectral and low spatial resolution, and vice versa,
%respectively.

Hyperspectral super-resolution is a problem of fusing a hyperspectral image
and a multispectral image of the same scene to form a full spectral image
having the high spectral resolution of the former and high spatial resolution
of the latter.
In the existing methods, some of them can be classified as matrix
factorization-based methods in which the desired full spectral image can be
expressed as the product of an endmember matrix and an abundance matrix.
The objective of this family of methods is to estimate the endmember-abundance
matrix pair solely from the hyperspectral and multispectral observations.
Conventionally, matrix factorization requires alternating optimization with
respect to each factor matrix individually.
This makes the hyperspectral super-resolution problem an iterative procedure
of solving subproblems with respect to the endmember matrix and abundance
matrix alternatingly.

In this thesis, some matrix factorization-based formulations of the
hyperspectral super-resolution problem are investigated.
In each of the investigation there are two major focus.
The first focus is on the effect of exactness of solving the subproblems
during alternating optimization against the fusion and unmixing performance,
measured by both reconstruction accuracy of full spectral images and the
unmixing accuracy of the endmember-abundnace matrix pair.
The second focus is on the fusion and unmixing performance using a variety of
first order optimization methods for solving the subproblems.

The contribution of this thesis is that a framework of alternating
optimization on matrix factorization is developed.
Simulation results show that by inexactly solving the subproblems, the
hyperspectral super-resolution problem can still be solved to comparable
accuracy but with much less computation time than the state of the art.
